# mitmproxy-hex-copy
mitmproxy chrome extension for copying and encoding hexadecimal values.

when you activate the extension, the `Copy Hex` menu is automatically added to the menu. click on your request and make the `view mode` hex if not hex.
if you want, you can click on the extension icon and base64 encode your hex value.

i don't know if there is such a feature or not. since i couldn't find it, i developed a small chrome extension myself.
